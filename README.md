# EnergyManagementSystemWebbapp

<h3>First phase</h3>
Develop an Energy Management System that consists of a frontend and two microservices
designed to manage users and their associated smart energy metering devices. The system can
be accessed by two types of users after a login process: administrator (manager), and clients

<h3>Second phase</h3>
Implement a Monitoring and Communication Microservice for the Energy Management System.
The microservice is based on a message broker middleware that gathers data from the
smart metering devices, processes the data to compute the hourly energy consumption and
stores it in the database of the Monitoring and Communication Microservice.

<h3>Third phase</h3>
Develop a chat microservice and an authorization component for the Energy Management
System. The authorization component should provide secured access of users to systemsâ€™ microservices.
The chat microservice should allow communication between the users and the
administrator of the system, allowing them to ask questions and receive answers.
